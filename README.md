### 1) Introduction
A digital angle gauge is implemented using MMA8451Q accelerometer interfaced via I2C bus. This project has an interactive command terminal which takes input from the user at which angle the saw blade is supposed to be inclined relative to the blade. Color of the LED changes to give user the idea whether the desired angle of the board is reached. White LED is turned on at zero-degree. Similarly, if the angle is less than desired angle, the color of the LED is nearer to red with its intensity increasing as the angle reaches closer to the angle given by the user. This can be seen with the intensity increasing in steps of RED LED. The color of the LED is Red at full intensity once the desired angle is reached. The color of the LED is nearer to Green if the angle is greater than the desired angle with its intensity increasing as the angle increases. The angle is also sent as output over UART every one second to at least one decimal for the user to see. This will give the user an idea whether they are getting close or moving away from the desired orientation and allow them to set the saw blade on a table saw to exactly any degree relative to the table. To calibrate the board for its 0 deg setting, a switch is connected over GPIO which generates an interrupt to indicate 0 deg. To give the command again for another input angle, one more switch is connected, triggering of which will stop displaying the angle over UART and prompt the user for another input. 

Note: The project is designed for range of angle between 0 to 180 degree. Any results (LED color and message over UART) for orientation more than 180 degree or lesser than 0 degree in either direction should be discarded. Negative angles should also be disregarded.

### 2) Command line
In this project we are using the following commands: 
1) author : Print the name of the author (Here, Darshit Nareshkumar Agrawal).
2) help: Print the relevant commands and their information.
3) input `<angle in degrees>`: Angle at which gauge has to be placed.
4) If the user gives command other than the above four, unknown command diagnostic message will be displayed.

### 3) Calibration
For calibrating the project, we have connected a switch at Port D pin 4. When the switch is pressed, the gauge will set the current angle at which it has been tilted as 0 and all the successive angles will be displayed as per this new reference. GPIO interrupt is used to handle this operation.

### 4) Taking Commands Again: 
If the user wishes to give command again for some other angle, another switch connected to Port D pin 5 is used. Pressing this switch will make the program to come out of inifinite loop, and prompt the user to give command again. Calibration will be back to zero reference. 

### 5) Testing
The below table gives testing details of different elements taken in the project.

### 6) LED Lights
LED colors will be changes and by using PWM, intensity of colors will also change.
1) If the angle is zero degree, color of the LED will be white.
2) If the angle is less than the input angle given by the user, RED LED will glow with its intensity increasing as the angle closes in to the desired angle.
3) At the input angle given by the user, color of the LED will be RED at full intensity.
4) At  angle greater than the input angle given by the user, color of the LED will be GREEN, with its intensity increasing as the angle increases from the input angle.
5) LED color will be VIOLET in case if MMA initialization fails.
